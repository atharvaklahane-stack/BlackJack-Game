Game Basics
Card Values:
Number cards (2–10) are worth their face value.
Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10.
Aces count as 1 or 11, whichever is more advantageous. 
Hand Goal: Get as close to 21 as possible without going over (called a bust). 
Winning Hands:
A natural blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card as the first two cards) pays 3:2 (1.5x your bet) immediately if the dealer doesn’t also have a blackjack.
If the dealer busts (goes over 21), all remaining players win.
If neither busts, the hand closest to 21 wins. 
Gameplay Flow
Place a bet in the designated betting box. 
Dealer deals two cards to each player (face up) and one to themselves (face up, and one face down in most games). 
Player decisions (in clockwise order from the dealer’s left):
Hit: Take another card.
Stand: Keep your current hand.
Double down: Double your bet and take exactly one more card.
Split: If your first two cards are equal (e.g., two 8s), split them into two hands and place a second bet.
Surrender: Forfeit half your bet and end the hand (available in some casinos). 
Dealer’s turn: After all players act, the dealer reveals their hole card. If the dealer has less than 17, they must hit; if 17 or higher, they stand. 
Outcome: Compare hands. If you beat the dealer (without busting), you win your bet. If you bust or lose to the dealer, you lose your bet. 
Key Rules & Strategy
No player vs. player competition — it’s always you vs. the dealer. 
Basic strategy (mathematically optimal decisions) can significantly reduce the house edge. 
Card counting (tracking high/low cards) is used by skilled players to gain an edge, though casinos discourage or ban it.
